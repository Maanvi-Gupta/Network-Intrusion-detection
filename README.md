# Network-Intrusion-detection
In this project, we aim to build an intelligent Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to help secure digital communication networks by monitoring network traffic in real time and detecting suspicious or harmful activities.

The system will be trained to recognize various types of cyber-attacks — including Denial of Service (DoS), Probing attacks, Remote to Local (R2L), and User to Root (U2R) attacks — and differentiate them from normal, safe network behavior. By analyzing patterns in the data, the model will provide early warnings when potential threats are detected, allowing quick responses to prevent damage or data breaches.

Ultimately, this project is about strengthening cybersecurity by using data-driven intelligence to stay a step ahead of attackers.
